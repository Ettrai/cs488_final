To execute the project it is sufficient to run it into an environment like WebStorm or using a local server like MAMP.

The android application is contained in the "Android" folder. It can be installed by importing the project in Android
Studio or by installing the .apk contained in the Android/app/build/ directory.

The android device and the computer on which the program is running have to be connected to the same Wi-Fi net. It is
suggested to use an ad-hoc connection.

Due to a problem with the menu the IP address of the android device is not settable from the menu itself. Instead, it is
necessary to hardcode it in the first lines of js/BlendCharacterGui file, under the "IP" key.
